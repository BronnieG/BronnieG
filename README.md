- 👋 Hi, I’m @BronnieG
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and ultimately become a full stack dev with a focus on blockchain projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and version control by doing projects on https://www.frontendmentor.io/ using the https://replit.com/ tools.
- 💞️ Current I am not looking to collaborate on any projects, however I am alwways open to hearing about sites that have help you on your coding journey.
